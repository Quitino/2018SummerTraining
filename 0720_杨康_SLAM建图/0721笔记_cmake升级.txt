Either use a PPA or compile it yourself:

Installation by a PPA (Upgrade to 3.2)

	$sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/cmake-3.x
	$sudo apt-get update
When cmake is not yet installed:

	$sudo apt-get install cmake
When cmake is already installed:

	$sudo apt-get upgrade
Compile it yourself

Currently, the latest version is 3.2.2, the following instructions based on this version. You should therefore check this URL and adjust the file name accordingly.

	$sudo apt-get install build-essential
	$wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.2/cmake-3.2.2.tar.gz
	$tar xf cmake-3.2.2.tar.gz
	$cd cmake-3.2.2
	$./configure
	$make
Now you can have to choose an installation type to decide, I recommend installing with checkinstall, as this creates a DEB package.

With checkinstall

	$sudo apt-get install checkinstall
	$sudo checkinstall


With make install
	$sudo make install
